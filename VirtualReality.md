* VR Capabilities & Shortcomings
    * Uses
        * Games (e.g. Robo Recall, Superhot)
        * Amusement parks (e.g. VR rides)
        * Simulations (e.g. Driving)
        * Training (e.g. Surgery)
        * Producing art (e.g. Tilt Brush)
        * Communication (e.g. VRChat, Rec room)
        * Meditation
    * Capabilities
        * Full visual immersion: can look in any direction just like in real life
        * 360 audio
        * Both eyes
        * Eye-tracking (in some)
        * Head & hand motion tracking (6 DOF)
        * Physics
        * Natural input
    * Shortcomings
        * Motion sickness
        * Only sight, missing all other senses
        * Low resolution, so hard to read text (right now)

* Understanding VR Development
        * The only difference between VR development and any other game development with Unity is input and output, most of which is abstracted.
        * Traditional input: 	keyboards/mouse
        * VR input:		head & hand position

* Making a VR App
        * I will quickly spin up and deploy an app for the Google Cardboard on my computer, which already has Unity and all the various SDKs installed to speed up the process.
        * I will pass the Cardboard down to let you see for yourselves.
