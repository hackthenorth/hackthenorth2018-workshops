**Key Notes:**
* Burnout
    * Burnout has multiple types
        * Frenetic
        * Underchallenged
        * Wornout 
    * Common causes
        * Resource imbalance
        * Conflict
        * Low control
    * Prevention
        * Examining stressors
            * Looking at them in terms of risk
            * Framing them in terms of person-job mismatch
        * Reducing stressors
        * Time management
        * Asking for help /  delegation
        * Self-Care (More on this later) 
    * Recovery
        * Find out why you are burned out
        * Proper goal setting
        * Learning to say no / delegate
        * Positive thinking
        * Talking to a peer or counsellor 

* Imposter Syndrome 
    * What is imposter Syndrome?
        * The idea that you don’t belong in your program / workplace because you are a fraud
    * This is important to talk about because if left unchecked imposter syndrome can destroy your self-confidence leaving you in a worse place than when you started
    * Who is to blame?
        * This has become very widespread in our culture 
        * Cannot blame one thing alone, but common suspects include:
            * Social media leading people to think life is better than normal
            * People using accomplishments to determine self worth
            * Goal oriented society
    * Strategies to combat:
        * Time
            * If you think your a fraud and don’t belong then wait and check that claim
            * If you don’t think you are fit to be an engineer but graduate then your claim was wrong 
        * Detaching accomplishments from self worth
            * You are worth more than the sum of your degree and accomplishments
            * Self-worth needs to come from within not outside
        * Learning to detach others from yourself
            * Be happy when people succeed but don’t let it crush your own self confidence   

* Self Care
    * No one can take better care of you than you! 
    * Without proper self care you mental health will suffer when times of stress come along
    * Having good mental health is like having a sturdy ship, when harsh winds come you are not broken
    * Stopping the “Who has it worse” completions 
        * Stop glorifying bad self-care
        * If someone says they only slept 2 hours last night, an effective response is not “oh I only slept 1” a good response is “you should really get more sleep”        
    * Common self-care strategies
        * 8 Hours a day of sleep
        * 3 Good meal a day
        * Dedicating time to staying active
        * Waking up and listing all the things you are looking forward to that day and the things you are proud you achieved yesterday
        * To do lists
        * Time management
        * Not being hard on yourself 
        
* Being an effective Peer Supporter 
    * All of us have a desire to help those around us
    * Not all of us can devote the time and energy into getting formal training
    * It is not hard to be a good peer supporter
    * Skills that a peer supporter needs
        * Active/empathic listening
        * [Brené Brown on Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw)
        * Non-judgmental tone
        * Empathy not sympathy
