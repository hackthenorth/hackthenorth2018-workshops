* Introduction
    * I’m Devon Boyer, currently in 4A Computer Science at UW
    * I’ve been developing iOS apps since 2013 starting with iOS7
    * I worked on the Shopify Point of Sale iOS app for my first UWaterloo co-op term in 2016 mostly working on refactoring the UI to use AutoLayout.

* iOS Development
    * Most knowledge about iOS is gained through experience in Apple’s frameworks (UIKit and Foundation)
    * 80% spent learning UIKit and other Apple frameworks, 20% learning Swift
    * Apple releases a new version of iOS every year and usually adds new frameworks

* Swift and Xcode
    * Optionals, named parameters
    * Xcode is the IDE used to develop iOS apps

* Cocoa Touch and 3rd Party Libraries
    * Dependency managers: CocoaPods
    * Alamofire (Networking)

* Models, Views, and View Controllers
    * Models
        * Contains data used to configure a view like the text that will be displayed in a label or the title of a button.
    * Views
        * Represents visual elements on the screen. Many useful built in views in UIKit.
    * View Controllers
        * Used to represent a “screen”. Basic building block of navigation.

* Interface Builder
    * Drag and drop editor in Xcode to design interfaces without writing any code.
